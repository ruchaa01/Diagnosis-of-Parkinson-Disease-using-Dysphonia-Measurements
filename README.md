# Diagnosis-of-Parkinson-Disease-using-Dysphonia-Measurements
Parkinson’s disease has affected more than ten million people all over the world, and is proven to alleviate the symptoms, if detected at an early stage. Exhibition of vocal impairment is one of the earliest indicators of Parkinson’s Disease. In the project, different types of data exploration and visualization techniques are used to learn about the voice signal features and their importance for prediction of Parkinson’s. Six independent classification schemas like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression with Neural Networks and Shallow Neural Network are applied and various evaluation methods are employed for calculating the performance score of these classifiers. Using 6 different ML algorithms and applying different optimization techniques, a comparative study was performed to get the highest accuracy for Shallow Neural Networks of 89.71%.
